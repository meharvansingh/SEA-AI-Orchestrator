**SikhEmpowermentAssociation AI Orchestrator**

The SEA AI Orchestrator is a custom-built AI-powered application designed to address a critical challenge in artificial intelligence: the generation of incorrect, misleading, or overly generic answers. By creating a customized solution using Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search, this project delivers accurate, contextually relevant answers tailored to user needs. Currently, the orchestrator serves a global user base of 1,000+ users across multiple countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.

**Why It Was Built**

While traditional AI models are powerful, they often provide unreliable or inconsistent answers, especially when dealing with nuanced or domain-specific queries. This project was built to:
	1.	Mitigate the risk of incorrect or misleading information by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
	2.	Deliver highly accurate and context-aware responses tailored to user queries.
	3.	Ensure ethical and responsible use of AI by embedding robust guardrails and a rule-based response system.

By addressing these issues, the SEA AI Orchestrator provides a reliable and user-centric solution for navigating complex queries.

**Project Overview**

The SEA AI Orchestrator was developed as part of a broader effort to enhance the reliability of AI-driven applications. Built on top of foundational Microsoft Azure repositories, the project extends their functionality to deliver a scalable and impactful solution.

**Key Deliverables**
	1.	Global AI Solution Deployment:
	•	Shipped a fully functional v2, operational in multiple countries, with significant adoption in the U.S. and Canada.
	•	Achieved over 1,000 active users, scaling seamlessly to meet increasing demand.
	2.	Enhanced Model Performance:
	•	Leveraged RAG pipelines to improve model accuracy by 30% and reduce response time by 42%.
	•	Ensured efficient processing of complex queries for high user satisfaction.
	3.	Responsible AI Framework:
	•	Designed and implemented guardrails for ethical AI usage, reducing risks associated with incorrect or biased outputs.
	•	Built a rule-based engine for customizable and contextually precise responses.
	4.	Seamless User Experience:
	•	Delivered a lightweight and intuitive user interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
	•	Supported by a scalable backend architecture with Python and Azure technologies for high-performance processing.

**Key Features**
	•	AI-Powered Query Handling: Combines Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search to deliver reliable, context-aware responses.
	•	Custom Query Management: Employs a rule-based engine for tailored handling of diverse user queries.
	•	Ethical AI Implementation: Ensures responsible and safe AI usage through embedded guardrails.

**How It Works**

The SEA AI Orchestrator was developed using an iterative and user-focused approach:
	1.	Research & Planning:
	•	Identified gaps in existing AI solutions, particularly in accuracy and contextual relevance.
	•	Defined project objectives to deliver reliable and efficient query handling.
	2.	Development:
	•	Built the backend architecture using Python and Flask for RESTful API integrations.
	•	Designed an intuitive and lightweight user interface to simplify user interactions.
	3.	Testing & Deployment:
	•	Conducted comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure robustness.
	•	Shipped v1 for live testing and used feedback to develop a globally deployed v2.
	4.	User Adoption:
	•	Currently supporting over 1,000 users across geographies, providing reliable AI-powered solutions for complex queries.

**Technologies Used**
	•	Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
	•	Frameworks: Flask, REST API Design
	•	Databases: Azure Cognitive Search
	•	Cloud Services: Azure OpenAI
	•	Methodologies: Agile, RAG Pipelines, Ethical AI Design
