# SEA AI Orchestrator

The **SEA AI Orchestrator** was developed to address a critical gap in existing AI solutions like ChatGPT and Gemini, which often provided incorrect or inconsistent responsesâ€”especially on topics related to Sikhism. The project aims to create a reliable, contextually accurate AI specifically designed to answer questions about Sikhism, leveraging a robust foundation of validated knowledge.

## Why SEA AI Orchestrator?

Existing AI models frequently struggle with accuracy, particularly on niche topics like Sikhism. Their responses were often unreliable, with a 50/50 chance of being correct or incorrect, which posed risks for users seeking factual and trustworthy information. The SEA AI Orchestrator was created to bridge this gap by:

- Ensuring factual correctness and cultural sensitivity for Sikhism-related queries.
- Providing users with validated and contextually relevant responses.
- Addressing the limitations of generic AI models by building a specialized solution tailored to the Sikh community.

## How It Works

The **SEA AI Orchestrator** integrates Microsoft Azure technologies with an innovative architecture to deliver accurate and reliable AI responses. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection and Storage**
   - Over 10,000 documents related to Sikhism were curated and stored in Azure Blob Storage.
   - These documents serve as the knowledge base, ensuring responses are rooted in verified information.

2. **Search and Retrieval**
   - Azure AI Search was connected to the Blob Storage to enable efficient indexing and retrieval of relevant documents.
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines were employed to enhance query accuracy by sourcing context from the knowledge base.

3. **Orchestration and Response Generation**
   - A Python-based orchestrator was developed to tie together the search capabilities with Azure OpenAI.
   - The orchestrator validates and refines responses, ensuring they are precise, contextually accurate, and aligned with Sikh values.

4. **Iterative Development**
   - The project was developed using an iterative, user-focused approach, incorporating feedback to continuously improve accuracy and user satisfaction.
